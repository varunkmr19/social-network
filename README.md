# PrivaLise 
### Social Media Network Focuses On Data Security And Being Community Driven Web App

## The Main Idea:
Can you imagine a centralized, but privacy-respecting social network? One that is modern, easy to use, fast and provides security and protection for everyone. That is why we created PrivaLise!

Encrypted credentials, 2 factor authentication, no associated personal information to hack... To Put It Simply: The Web App will not record anything about its users. <br/>
We actively avoid using any 3rd party software, such as google APIs, google analytics, any FAANG framework (React, Vue...), so rest assured that you will be totally anonymous :D

We also plan on creating an onion version of the web, so stay tunned!!

## Community: contribute or hang out with the developers!

## The Technology Behind It:
   * Python 3.9.2
   * Django 2.2.22
   * Pure HTML/CSS/JS

## Main Features:
   * Sign IN/UP/OUT
   * Post CRUD
   * Update Username / Profile Pic
   * Infinite Scroll On The Home Page
   * Password Recovery / Change
   * 2 factor authentication

## New front-end
The entire front-end is being completely re-designed from the ground up. In order to iterate faster, it has been separated into its own repository, and in the near future it will be incorporated into this one.

 ## Set Up: 
  * Clone The Repository `git clone https://github.com/privalise/social-network.git && cd privalise`
  * Install Requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt && cd privalises`
  * Let's Migrate And Make Migrations `python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate`
  * Now Finally We Will Run The Server `python manage.py runserver`
  
 ### Additional Steps:
  1. Create '.env' file in the root directory
  2. Specify The Following
	  * email (Add The EMAIL_HOST_USER)
	  * pass (Specify The EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD)
	  * port  (Specify The EMAIL_PORT)
	  * hash  (Specify The SECRET_KEY)
	  * backend (Specify The EMAIL_BACKEND)
	  * host (Specify The EMAIL_HOST)
	  * tls (Specify The EMAIL_USE_TLS)
	 ### In The End It Should Look Like This:
	  ```python
	  email=email@email.email
	  pass=password
	  hash=gjkmjgbkjbgmoirejoibjgboikejrgkjstojmsvoiigormjoiysmdfvmg
	  port=587
	  tls=True
	  host=smtp.provider.com
	  backend=django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend	
	  ```
